What's this then?
-----------------

This is Barkanoid, a vaguely dog-themed Breakout / Arkanoid clone with a few twists. The project exists purely as a C programming exercise because I needed to brush up my skills. 


What's the objective?
---------------------

Are you serious? It's a Breakout clone. You use the bat to hit the bricks. When all the bricks are destroyed (of those that can be destroyed) you move on to the next level. There are power-ups (and power-downs) to collect along the way, and at some point there might be enemies and warp bubbles and all sorts.


Who did the graphics?
---------------------

I did. 


Who did the music?
------------------

I did. Good, isn't it?


What's the licence?
-------------------

It may not be mentioned anywhere, but the licence is GPLv3.
